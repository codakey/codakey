## What is Codakey?

**Codakey** turns learning open-source into a game. Pick any project — React, Next.js, Drizzle, whatever interests you — and play through an interactive journey of typing challenges and clicker gameplay built around real code from that project.

Instead of passively reading docs, you **type actual code**, learn how projects are structured, and build muscle memory for real-world patterns — all while earning XP, leveling up, and unlocking upgrades.

*Type real code from open-source projects. Earn XP. Level up.*

</div>

## How it works

```
1. Browse & pick a project        →  Curated library of open-source projects
2. Play through the journey       →  5 stages mixing prose, code typing & clicker challenges
3. Learn by doing                 →  Type real code, understand architecture, see how it all fits
4. Track your progress            →  WPM, accuracy, XP, levels, and upgrades
```

## Features

- **Typing mode** — Type to match real code from open-source projects, with autocomplete upgrades
